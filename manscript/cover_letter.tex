Dear Editor,

We are submitting our manuscript 
``Viral genetic determinants of prolonged human orthopneumovirus infection''. 

Herein, we performed surveillance of 1741 infants with
natural quasi random infection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) which included monitoring by RT-qPCR, serology, and sequencing.
We performed viral genetic association testing to detect variants that contribute to prolonged infection.
We identified viral genetic variants that associated with prolonged infection which we assessed in depth.
As a disease which causes significant morbidity and mortality, each advance in preventative measures can have lasting consequences for global health.

In-line with the journal's aims, the data and analysis is public, and our work is reproducible.

\closing{Your Sincerely,
}
