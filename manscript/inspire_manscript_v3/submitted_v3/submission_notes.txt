## Irritations

Upload took about 2 hours to make sure all data was entered on drop down menus, correct title style so that all authors match, document automated reformatting.
MS word only.
Title must be <64 characters.
Please upload a single file...
Cover letter option only appears after attaching first file.
Country of origin.. (what paper is only from one country today?).
Do you accept the additional fee for color figure printing? 
Add funding sources with drop down menu of "all" possible sources, very slow for several.
.docx file is formatted before converting to PDF (e.g. a logical page break is now different due to a change in font/size).
