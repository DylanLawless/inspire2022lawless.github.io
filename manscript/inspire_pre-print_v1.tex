\section{Abstract}
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a seasonal mucosal pathogen that infects the respiratory epithelium and results in the most severe morbidity in the first six months of life. 
RSV is a common cause of acute respiratory infection during infancy with nearly all children becoming infected by the age of two years.
Infection and immunological response are shaped by both host and pathogen genetics as well as other environmental factors. 
Our surveillance cohort of 1741 infants with
natural quasi random infection events included monitoring by RT-qPCR, serology, and sequencing. 
We performed viral genetic association testing to detect variants that contribute to persistent infection.
Analysis controlled for all know demographic factors including host age, sex, ethnicity, sibling contact transmission, viral population, and we have previously excluded host genetic causes of infection susceptibility.
We identify RSV variants in surface G glycoprotein that were associated with persistent infection, investigated their functional role, and reviewed all publicly available pathogen sequence data spanning several decades. 
RSV plays a major role in global health and remains a target for vaccine development.
Strong evidence also supports RSV as a modifiable risk factor for asthma development. Preventing or delaying infant infection is likely to have a positive impact on life-long human health worldwide.

\section{Introduction}
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a human orthopneumovirus, is the single most important respiratory virus to global health and resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in infants 
\cite{hall_burden_2009}.
By the age of two years, nearly all children are infected with RSV at least once 
\cite{glezen_risk_1986}.
RSV infects primarily the upper and lower respiratory tract epithelium, although has been recovered from non-airway sources 
\cite{bokun_respiratory_2019,
cubie_detection_1997,
nadal_isolation_1990,
odonnell_respiratory_1998,
rezaee_respiratory_2011,
rohwedder_detection_1998}.
Prolonged shedding of RSV, especially in young infants and following first infection, has been demonstrated, with longer average duration of viral shedding using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect RSV 
\cite{munywoki_influence_2015}.
While younger age and first infection are associated with persistence of infection, what is not understood is whether there are viral factors contributing to prolonged shedding or persistence of RSV in young infants. 
This is important, as persistent infection, or prolonged shedding may contribute to enhanced transmission and developmental changes to the early life airway epithelium. 
Further, the reservoir of RSV infection is not understood, 
and it is possible that some RSV strains and/or hosts could serve as a dormant reservoir for infection that is activated by seasonal or other influences 
\cite{hobson_persistent_2008}.
Host genetic and viral genetic interactions have never been studied for RSV.
With increasing adoption of human genomics in parallel with pathogen sequencing, novel methods for genome-to-genome analysis provide opportunities to identify selective pressure between host and pathogen \cite{naret2018correcting}.
We have previously investigated host genetics as a source of susceptibility to infection.
GWAS analyses adjusted for 
all known covariates revealed no significant associations.
We also estimated narrow sense heritability of RSV liability $h_l$ to be 0, indicating no accumulation of small genetics effects. 
The prior probability of rare variants as a cause of susceptibility
to infection in our cohort is extremely low and reinforced by our enrollment criteria (cite).
Several environmental factors have a significant impact on the risk of infection. 
Population genetics also contributes important features that must be accounted for during genetics association analysis. 
These features not only depend on host genetics as seen within a typical genome-wide association study (GWAS), but also depend on viral genetics.
Analysis of viral populations not only requires variant-level information, but genome-wide information since pathogen fitness can modulate the effect of variant-specific mutation.  
RSV strains A and B impart the largest separation within the viral population phylogeny and are important features to control, similar to the use of principal component analysis (PCA) in human GWAS.
In this study we perform genomic analysis of RSV to identify variants that are significantly associated with persistent infection in otherwise healthy children.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Study population}
The protocol and informed consent documents were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
One parent of each participant in the cohort study provided written informed consent for participation in this study. 
The informed consent document explained study procedures, use of data and biospecimens for future studies, including genetic studies.

The study population is a longitudinal birth cohort - The INfant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure in Infancy Birth Cohort (INSPIRE) - specifically designed to capture the first RSV infection during infancy in a term healthy birth cohort. 
Additional details of this birth cohort have been previously published 
\cite{larkin_objectives_2015}.
Briefly, the cohort includes 1952 term ($\ge$ 37 weeks gestation), non-low birth weight ($\ge$ 2250 g, 5 lbs), otherwise healthy infants from a population-representative sample of pediatric practices located in a rural, suburban, and urban regions of the southeastern US during 2012-2014. 
Infants were born June through December so that they would, by design, be 6 months of age or less entering their first RSV season. 
Infant (i.e., the first year of life) RSV infection was ascertained through passive and active biweekly surveillance during each infants' first RSV season and RSV serology
(Table \ref{tab:1}).

\subsection{Biweekly surveillance of RSV infection}
To capture all RSV infections of children enrolled in INSPIRE throughout infancy (i.e., the first year of life), we conducted passive and active surveillance during their first RSV season by 1) performing bi-weekly phone, email, and/or in person follow-up, 2) frequently educating and reminding parents to call us at the onset of any acute respiratory symptoms, and 3) approaching all infants who were seen at one of the participating pediatric practices for an unscheduled visit. 
If an infant met pre-specified criteria for an acute respiratory infection, we then conducted an in-person respiratory illness visit at which time we administered a parental questionnaire, performed a physical exam, collected a nasal wash, and (in infants seen during an unscheduled visit) completed a structured medical chart review.
Nasal sample collections were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR for RSV [Jim to provide reference].
At one year of age infants underwent blood draw for RSV serology to determine infection status during infancy. 
[Plots with CT-value from Tina, either as supplemental or first mention later so not to pollute the order].
Infants with positive PCR separated by 15 or more days were annotated during analysis as ``persistent or repeat infection''
(Figure \ref{fig:1}).

\subsection{Descriptive analyses}
Descriptive analyses of the cohort were conducted using R 4.0.5 (available at: 
\url{http://www.r-project.org}). 
Pearson or Wilcoxon tests were used for comparing infants with and without persistent RSV infection.
The main descriptive features are provided in 
Table \ref{tab:1}.
[Consider plotting these also in the Hmisc Harrell style as seen in his book, RegerssionModellingStrategies2015].

\subsection{RSV whole-genome sequencing}
RSV whole-genome sequencing of this study population has been previously described 
\cite{schobel_respiratory_2016}.
Briefly, RNA was extracted at J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) (\url{https://www.jcvi.org}) in Rockville, MD from nasal wash samples which were RSV PCR positive and collected during a respiratory illness visit triggered through biweekly surveillance of symptoms. 
Four forward reverse transcription (RT) primers were designed and four sets of PCR primers were manually picked from primers designed across a consensus of complete RSV genome sequences using JCVI’s automated primer design tool,
\cite{li_automated_2012}.
cDNA was generated from \SI{4}{\micro\liter}  undiluted RNA, using the pooled forward primers and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 
100 ng of pooled DNA amplicons were sheared to create 400-bp libraries, which were pooled in equal volumes and cleaned. 
For samples requiring extra coverage, in addition to Ion Torrent sequencing, Illumina libraries were prepared using the Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). 
Sequence reads were sorted by barcode, trimmed, and de novo assembled using CLC Bio's \textit{clc\_novo\_assemble} program, and the resulting contigs were searched against custom, full-length RSV nucleotide databases to find the closest reference sequence. 
All sequence reads were then mapped to the selected reference RSV sequence using CLC Bio's \textit{clc\_ref\_assemble\_long} program 
\cite{bioWhite2016}.

% <!-- ## Data merged and cleaned -->
% <!--Label repeat infections -->
Viral sequence data and clinical information was merged and cleaned with R.
Clinical IDs matching more than one viral sequence ID were used to re-identify samples from the same individual as ``repeat or persistent'' infections. 
Genetic variation was quantified in these samples and for subsequent analysis only the first viral sequence was included for association testing. 
Typing of strain A and B had been completed previously and labels were included to annotate each sample accordingly.

The cohort-specific variant frequency per position was calculated;
residues were counted and ranked by frequency
with the most frequent residue defined as reference (REF) and alternative (ALT) for variants.
Positions with at least one ALT were checked for potential misalignment or other sources of error. 
Variants positions were selected for association analysis, while non-variant position were ignored.

A number of host features have been previously shown to influence infection susceptibility and were therefore included as covariates in our analysis (cite Rosas-Salazar).
Six samples were excluded due to insufficient covariate data, resulting in 344 test samples. 
Of these, 36 were from the same patients (``persistent or repeat'' infection) of which half (18) were included for association testing; 326 samples total.
% <!--Correlations viewed with: corrplot, ggcorrplot, caret.-->

\subsection{Population structure}
The genetic distances to nearest neighbors were computed based on phylogenetic 
trees generated with MAFFT.
[Other methods also used but not pertinent; include some info from the code].
Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) were used in dimensionality reduction for exploratory data analysis of viral phylogeny.
R package \textit{factoextra} was used for PCA, and to visualise eigenvalues and variance. 
R package \textit{caret} was used to analyse genetic correlations.

\subsection{Association testing}
Viral amino acids (genotype collapsed into REF/ALT) were tested for association with infection types \textit{single} and \textit{persistent}, 
including key covariates that are significantly associated with infection.
Analysis was performed using logistic regression with the
R stats (3.6.2) \textit{glm} function as a generalized linear model.
The model consisted of the binary response (persistent infection Yes/No), and predictors; viral genotype (REF/ALT amino acid), viral PCs 1-5, host sex, and it also accounted for host features that have been previously demonstrated as significantly associated with infection; 
self-reported race/ethnicity, child-care attendance, living with siblings (cite Rosas-Salazar).

% $ glm(\text{Infection status} \text{\textasciitilde} \text{genotype} + \text{PCs} + \text{birth month} + \text{sex} + \text{race} + \text{child-care} + \text{siblings}, \text{family} = \text{'binomial'}) $

The environmental host covariates did not contribute any significant effect in our model for the candidate-causal association.
Two viral PCs were included in our model for accuracy, however the clinical 
strain labels (A/B) also reflected the same cohort population structure.
% [Check the \% VE from PC scree plot stats to 1 decimal place and list it here.]
Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied based on the number of independent variants tested.
R package \textit{stats} was used for a range of analysis including glm for logistic regressions. 
R package \textit{MASS} was used to analyse logistic regression model data.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Cohort characteristics}
The INSPIRE cohort consisted of 1,949 enrolled infants 
(Figure \ref{fig:1}).
Of these, 1,220 ($\sim 63\%$) had $\ge$ 1 in-person respiratory illness visit(s). 
In total, there were 2,093 in-person respiratory illness visits completed and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of in-person respiratory illness visits per infant was 1 (1-2). 
% The characteristics of these infants compared with the other RSV infected infants and the entire cohort is shown in Table 1.
From the cohort, 344 RSV viral samples from 326 individuals were sequenced.
There were 19 infants with RSV-positive PCR $\ge$ 15 days apart who we suspected as having either persistent or repeat infection (based on genetic analysis).
% <!-- Also those who were sick enough to have a resp illness visit. --> 
Table \ref{tab:1} lists the cohort characteristics of infants with persistent RSV infection compared with other RSV infection and the entire cohort. 
Repeat or persistent infection is defined as RSV sequence positive with $\ge$ 15 days between testing.
% Pearson1, Wilcoxon2.
% <!-- There are other variables that we can include, although this seems sufficient. -->
% [For Tebeb: We will need to recalculate this to represent just the first infection, as this small number infections include repeat infections which likely drives the median higher.]

The relatively small sample size of our cohort required analysis that targeted only genes which were \textit{a priori} likely to functionally contribute to the clinical phenotype. 
Therefore, our analysis focused on F and G glycoproteins (citations probably not required: PMC8310105, 33115881, 23598484, 31533056).
No association was identified for F protein and is therefore omitted from discussion.
% <!-- [Include some points for our reasoning; -->
% <!-- Would we have false positives in other genes? -->
% <!-- We can interpret the results in F and G. -->
% <!-- These are the surface proteins that are most studied for vaccine development etc. -->
% <!-- Variation in other genes is lower; quantify this. --> 
% <!-- G and SH are variable more than others. -->
% <!-- M2 also has a fair amount of sequence variation. --> 
% <!-- F is more variable than others but maybe not the most so. --> 
% <!-- * Surface, entry, targets of immune response. --> 
% <!-- * F - Primary candidate for vaccine. --> 
% <!-- * Biological plausability is higher than others. --> 
% <!-- * G surface "glycoprotein", F - careful with terms. -->
% <!-- Larry / Suman can help. -->
% <!-- Their clinical relevance.] -->

\subsection{Population structure}
The phylogenetic tree based on G protein is shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:2} A.
One obvious feature causing a separation in genetic diversity is seen due to the G protein partial gene duplication, 
which has emerged in recent years within RSV-A strains 
\cite{eshaghi2012genetic}.
RSV-B strains with an analogous duplication have existed for two decades, 
although the mechanisms leading to emergence and clinical implications have not been entirely defined.

We observed repeat or persistent infections by viruses from different phylogenetic clades, rather than one specific clade 
(Figure \ref{fig:2} B).
A genotype correlation matrix and PCA eignenvalues were used for reducing the dimensionality of sequence data.
Figure \ref{fig:2} scree plot show that dimension one accounted for 95.19\% cumulative variance explained in our cohort.
All other dimensions account for very little variance, which is evenly distributed; no particular protein coding sequence separated the cohort.
          % <!-- eigenvalue variance.percent cumulative.variance.percent -->
% <!-- Dim.1   1.608637e+02     9.518559e+01                    95.18559 -->
For his reason, in our main analysis, viral population structure is accounted for by the first five PCs. 
To test for type I errors due to the population structure between strain A and B, 
a subset analysis of individual strains was performed to confirm the validity of the combined analysis.
% <!-- The main analysis was also repeated using viral strain labels A and B (separately derived from the clinical laboratory testing) instead of PCs which did not alter the analysis results, indicating no errors in sample handling. --> 

% Note for presentation slides: there is no general theoretical reason that the most informative linear function of the predictor variables should lie among the dominant principal components of the multivariate distribution of the predictor variables. 
% However, if there were then we would like to know since it would produce a false positive in this case. Conversely, for example, in a principal component regression you would hope to find the assoc based on PCs.

\subsection{Genetic invariance of persistent infection}
The duration of RSV shedding duration in Kenyan infants has been reported previously
\cite{okiro2010duration}.
 % <!-- \url{https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-10-15#Sec1} -->
% <!-- This is the follow up. Ask Tina about the first paper too. --> 
Based on these finding, infections separated by at least 15 days were expected to be ``new'' infections. 
% <!-- In addition to our within-cohort genetic analysis showing --> 
Figure \ref{fig:2} C
shows genetic invariance between viral sequences within the same host for infections separated by at least 15 days. 
There is a significant difference between the genetic diversity for multiple viral samples from individuals compared to diversity between all other samples from the same viral clades; $\text{P-value} = 1.3e^{-8}$.
We therefore refer to these cases as persistent infection rather than second infections.
% <!-- Have a look at update figure but the first version might be fine. --> 
\subsection{Variants in G glycoprotein significantly associated with persistent infection}
The consensus sequence within the cohort was assigned based on the major allele.
Variants at the amino acid level were defined as either REF/ALT and assessed for their association with persistence.
The model consisted of
the binary response (persistent infection Yes/No),
and predictors; viral genotype (REF/ALT amino acid), viral PCs 1-5, host sex, and it also accounted for host features that have been previously demonstrated as significantly associated with infection;
self-reported race/ethnicity, child-care attendance, or living with siblings
\cite{hall1976respiratory}.

Analysis was performed using R stats (3.6.2) \textit{glm} function. 
% <!-- glm ( infection ~ genotype + PCs + sex + other). -->
A significant genetic association was identified for persistent infection after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (threshold for number independent variants $<0.05/23=0.002$), 
as shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:3} A. 
Since many variants within RSV coding genes have non-random association due to strong linkage disequilibrium (LD), 
we reduced the multiple testing burden by retaining proxy variants and removing those with
$r^2 \ge 0.8$.
After identifying a significant association with persistent infection,
we quantified the correlation of variants in LD with the lead proxy.
% <!-- Conditional analysis was used to identify any independant signal. --> 
% <!-- Pruning, go through methods with Chris multiple test correction with threshold set at number of proxy SNVs rather than gene-wide SNV number. -->
Clumping was performed with ranking based on minor allele frequency (MAF) and with a cut-off threshold of $r^2 \ge 0.8$.
The association model was repeated for all variants to produce a LocusZoom-style Manhattan plot with $r^2$ by color and P-value statistics as shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:3} B.
This shows both G protein 
% <!-- "V126" --> 
p.E123K/D and 
% <!-- "V221" --> 
p.P217T/S/L as candidate causal variants associated with persistent infection, and no other variants in correlation with this association. 

To determine whether this association was simply due to population stratification between strains A and B, a subset analysis was performed using independently assessed clinical laboratory strain labels for A and B.
% <!-- Show how strains are defined in the genome sequence. --> 
% <!-- ## Shown not just false positive, accounting for population structure and strain, --> 
The same direction of effect indicated that the association was not a false positive, although the smaller sample size means that sub-analysis result no longer passes the significant threshold. 
% State the OR in same direction with overlapping SE.

To assess the possibility of a false positive due to population structure within our cohort,
we assessed the magnitude of variance explained (VE) by the lead variant and found it as 
$-0.996\%$ VE for PC1 and $-1.66\%$ VE for PC2; 
a negligible effect that precludes spurious association by allele frequency between populations, as shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:3} C.

To investigate genetic variance over time
we assessed the public viral data repository of NCBI Human orthopneumovirus, taxid:11250 which contained data from 
27 unique countries worldwide, sample collection dates as far back as 1956, and 1084 glycoprotein protein sequences after curation.
We observed no enrichment for our variants of interest over time; 
a low frequency was observed in the available samples with no particular features compared to other low frequency variants. 
However, correlation between the two positions associated with persistent infection indicates that it does not arise as random mutation event.


\subsection{Functional interpretation}
The main features of RSV surface glycoprotein are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:5}.
The variant associated with persistent infection in our cohort are seen in the extracellular region. 
There are no known mechanistic features that directly overlap. 
Figure \ref{fig:5} shows the possible site for  initiation of infection by interaction of heparan sulfate and host cell membrane (p.187-198), during the  \cite{levine1987demonstration, feldman1999identification, feldman2000fusion}.
Protein structure evidence from PDB was insufficient to determine an effect on conformation. 
Paramyxoviridae cell attachment proteins (G protein in RSV) span the viral envelope and project from the surface as spikes 
% [note: confirm the consensus] A/B; 
(1-43 cytoplasmic, 43-63 helical, 64-298 extracellular).
Interactions  have been identified with protein SH 
\cite{rixon2005respiratory} 
and via the N-terminus with protein M 
\cite{ghildyal2005interaction} (Figure \ref{fig:5}).
G protein has been reported to form homo-oligomers (which we will check next for interaction residues. remove this citation if not fruitful)
\cite{collins1992oligomerization}.
Known neutralization epitopes were not found at these positions.
Figure \ref{fig:5} shows the isoform of mature secreted glycoprotein G is reported for amino acid positions p.66 – 298, including the variants of interest.

\subsection{Clinical and interferon response}
These variants were not associated with more severe infection in patients. 
Infections were on average less severe compared with other circulating variants, and resulting in upper respiratory tract infection (Table \ref{tab:1}). 
We also assessed the association of nasal cytokines in nasal wash samples during acute infection as anti-viral immune response biomarkers with the variants of interest.
IFN$\alpha$ and IFN$\gamma$ were associated with strain A/B
(double check and report the final values here). 
Since the viral strains correlate with the presence of our variants of interest, co-linearity meant that it was not possible to attribute these variants as the cause of a differential interferon response.
However, this more pronounced antiviral response is unlikely to be due to the variants associated with persistent infection and more likely due to other features that separate strain A and B; an observation that has been anecdotally reported previously 
(do we have a reference to strain B being more pathogenic than strain A - rephrase if the reports are anecdotal or common knowledge). 

\section{Discussion}
In this study of term healthy infants in whom we identified their first RSV infection through surveillance, we conducted a viral genetic association study and identified variants associated with persistent infection. 
The variants were not associated with severe disease, had not arisen as a recent mutation, and have persisted in the population at a low prevalence for decades.
We hypothesized that they might induce dampened anti-viral immune responses making it more difficult to be cleared. 
However, we were unable to demonstrate so using nasal cytokine data.
Since these variants are co-linear with strain A and B, the differences in antiviral response are most likely strain-dependent rather than due to these particular variants.
We do not expect any host immune memory before this first infection, potentially beyond maternal antibody.

%\subsection{limitations}
While this study has a number of significant strengths, including this being one of few population-based studies of the first RSV infection during infancy regardless of symptoms among a term healthy infant population, there are limitations which must be considered.
This cohort was not designed to study persistence of infection, and repeat sampling following initial RSV infection was only done based on symptoms and likely missed some persistent infections in this population. 
This resulted in a small number of persistent infections to study.
The small sample size also required focus on surface proteins for their prior probability of association and interpretation.
A larger cohort may in future perform a whole genome analysis.

%\subsection{asthma}
A host genetic interaction for asthma has been demonstrated previously 
\cite{moffatt2010large}.
We performed an interaction analysis for the outcome of host asthma, host genetics, and pathogen genetics 
but no significant interaction was found. 
However, our sample size is unlikely to be sufficient to answer this question, 
which may be addressed with future studies. 

%\subsection{Other genetics}
Genomic analysis of both human and pathogen in tandem is being increasingly adopted. 
Application of the same statistical methods that are commonly used for human GWAS while extending the boundary from host genome to pathogen genome can allow for robust analysis of novel genotype-phenotype associations.
In this study we combine the outcome of host phenotype and covariates with the pathogen genotype as a predictor. 
Cohort sizes as little as 2-3 times larger than that reported here are capable of detecting signals in genome-to-genome analysis
\cite{fellay2020exploring}.  % temp use this citation but switch to Mack's if available. % \cite{mack hbv, n=400}.
While we have not overtly assessed patients for rare monogenic variants that may cause an underlying immunodeficiency, our enrollment criteria included only patients who were otherwise healthy.
We have also previously demonstrated that there is no evidence for host genetic susceptibility due to common variants for risk of infection with RSV during infancy (cite). 
%your ESHG abstract, and if our other paper is published).
Accounting for host genetic factors allowed our analysis to focus on the viral genetic features which drive 
persistence.
The possibility of viral mutational immune escape has been reported for 
infants who struggle to control primary RSV infections, allowing for prolonged viral replication and not previously described viral rebound
\cite{brint2017prolonged}.

%\subsection{functional interpret}
We suspected that the variants of interest may either be enriched by selective pressure over time, however inspecting public data from the last two decades shows presence of these variants at low frequencies.
Within-host variation with \textit{de novo} mutation may allow variants to present within some individuals but failing to persist within the population, however, we have not been able to conclusively assess this possibility.
Why these variants, which appear quite stable, have persisted at low frequency in the population for decades is uncertain. 
It is possible that a virus that persists or is cleared less rapidly may have a greater impact on epigenetic changes and reprogramming of the developing airway epithelium, or results in a low-level chronic stimulation or immune exhaustion. 
We have previously demonstrated that infants infected with RSV in their first year of life have dampened subsequent anti-viral immune responses in early childhood (Frontiers in Immunol Chirkova T et al. under review) as well as changes in airway epithelial cell metabolism 
\cite{connelly2021metabolic}.

Known neutralization epitopes were not found for our variant site (Jim).
Attachment of the virion to the host cell membrane is thought to occur through interaction with heparan sulfate as shown in Figure \ref{fig:5}
(p.187-198), thereby initiating infection 
\cite{levine1987demonstration, feldman1999identification, feldman2000fusion}.
Specifically, interactions between viral G protein and host CX3CR1, the receptor for the CX3C chemokine fractalkine, have been reported to modulate the immune response and facilitate infection 
\cite{johnson2015respiratory, tripp2001cx3c, jeong2015cx3cr1}.
CX3CR1 well known as a coreceptor for HIV-1. 
Variations in \textit{CX3CR1} are known to have important effects on the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and the hosts' potential for controlling infection [cite, ask Jacques].
In general, viral envelope glycoproteins bind to specific cellular receptors and initiate fusion with the host cell membrane, 
which allows the penetration of the viral genome into host cells. 
The negative-strand RNA family of Paramyxoviridae rely on a pair of binding and fusion functions for infection, mediated by one or multiple envelope glycoproteins,
which span the viral envelope and project from the surface as spikes 
%[confirm the consensus domain position here for A/B; 
(p.1-43 cytoplasmic, 43-63 helical, 64-298 extracellular).
These proteins are generally designated as either hemagglutinin (H), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), or glycoprotein (G). 
Haemagglutination activity which is responsible for the binding of virus (i.e. Influenza) to sialic acid on the surface of target cells.
Haemagglutination and neuraminidase (HN) activity cleaves sialic acid on the cell surface, preventing viral particles from reattaching to previously infected cells. 
Unlike the other paramyxovirus attachment proteins, 
RSV glycoprotein lacks hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) activities.
It uses the attachment protein with neither haemagglutination nor neuraminidase activity, designated as G (glycoprotein), which are found in henipaviruses.
\cite{takimoto2002role, malvoisin1993measles, hu1992functional, horvath1992biological, bousse1994regions}
The mature isoform of secreted glycoprotein G is believed to help the virus escape antibody-dependent restriction of replication by acting as an antigen decoy and by modulating the activity of leukocytes bearing Fc-gamma receptors 
\cite{bukreyev2008secreted}.
This secreted isoform is reported for amino acid positions p.66 – 298, and includes the variants associated with persistent infection in our analysis.

\subsection{Host GWAS for genetic susceptibility to infection}

Include the section on sample collection and genotyping array used. 
These notes are in the raw genotype directory. 

To determine whether a genetic susceptibility to infection was evident in our cohort, 
we perfromed a GWAS analysis of 663 of samples from our cohort
% <!--Reference that abstract from the ESHG. -->
\cite{lawless2020genome}.
% <!--Their paper on this should be done in the next motnth. -->
Samples were genotyped using X genotyping array and genotypes were called using Illumina GenomeStudio. 
Study participants were excluded based on a missing genotype call rate of 10%. 
Subject independence was assessed using 
 KING (\url{https://people.virginia.edu/~wc9c/KING/})
any samples with a high degree of kinship or duplication 
(pairwise identify-by-state (IBS) estimated kinship coefficient $> 0.18$) were removed 
\cite{manichaikul_robust_2010}. 

Variants were removed for minor allele frequencies $<0.05$, missingness $>0.1$, 
and additionally for controls, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) $P <1E-6$.
Reported and estimated sex was examined for discrepancy. 
We compared the genetic ancestry in cases to self-reported ethnicity to check for mislabeling. 
Genotyping data was phased 
[SHAPEIT2]
\url{https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/shapeit/shapeit.html}
and imputed 
[IMPUTE2] 
\url{https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/impute_v2.html}
using the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 reference panel. 
The reference genome build and LD population used was hg19/1000G Nov2014 EUR. 
Imputation quality was assessed and SNPs with an information score of $<0.8$ or minor allele frequency $<0.05$ were removed.

GCTA \url{https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/}
was used to calculate the genetic relationship matrix (GRM) and to 
perform principal component analysis (PCA) 
to quantify population structure 
\cite{yang_gcta_2011}. 
Datasets were merged using PLINK v1.9. SNP positions and identifiers were 
updated according to dbNSFP4.0a (hg19) 
\cite{liu_dbnsfp_2016}.
QC was repeated after merging cases and controls for combined cohort-specific 
frequencies. 
Genome-wide association analysis was performed using PLINK version 1.9 for logistic regression with multiple covariates that included the child’s birth month, enrollment year (as a marker of RSV season), daycare attendance, the presence of another child less than 6 years of age at home, and 6 ancestry principal components as covariates
Population structure was controlled by GRM eigenvectors and analysis covariates consisted of sex, age, and study site.
